# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup
### ZSH autocompletions
Add the two following lines at the end of your ~/.zshrc file then reopen a new terminal:
```
[[ $commands[kubectl] ]] && source <(kubectl completion zsh)
[[ $commands[minikube] ]] && source <(minikube completion zsh)
```

If you type minikube <TAB> or kubectl <TAB> it should give you a list of commands

Furthermore, install the dependencies using Poetry:
```
pip install poetry
poetry install
poetry shell
```

### VScode Extensions
Before you get started there are some key extensions we need for VSCode to make developing k8s a breeze ü•∂. Make sure you have Kubernetes, Kubernetes templates, and YAML - all highlighted in the image below üëá.

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Launching Minikube
The first step is to make sure that your Docker daemon is running. One way to do this is to start Docker Desktop on your machine. Then run the following command from your terminal:
```bash
minikube start
```

Starting minikube can take a few minutes. You should get the following message:
```bash
üèÑ  Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default
```

This means that you are now able to interact with the minikube cluster using `kubectl`. One thing that we can do is to inspect the cluster node:
```bash
kubectl get node
```

You should see something like:
```
NAME       STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
minikube   Ready    control-plane   76d   v1.25.2
```

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Build and run docker images inside your cluster
‚ùì Use the following command to build and run docker image inside the `minikube` environment:
```bash
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

See the [following](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52310599/what-does-minikube-docker-env-mean) Stackoverflow page for a more elaborate explanation of this.

‚ùì Now build the Dockerfile against the docker inside Minikube, which is instantly accessible to Kubernetes cluster.
```
docker build -t app .
```

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Create a K8s Service
‚ùì Create your own `api-service.yaml` in the `k8s-deployment/api` folder and populate it with a `LoadBalancer` service, with name `fastapi-service` and selector app: `fastapi`. What port should you it target ?

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'> üí° Target hint </summary>
    The target port should correspond to the port on which you are exposing your Fastapi application.
</details>

‚ùì Apply the service by running:
```bash
kubectl apply -f api-service.yaml
```

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Create a K8s Deployment
‚ùì Create a configuration file for our deployment - `k8s-deployment/api/api-deployment.yaml`
‚ùì Apply the deployment by running:
```bash
kubectl apply -f api-deployment.yaml
```

# 6Ô∏è‚É£ Forwarding the service
```bash
kubectl port-forward service/fastapi-service 8000:4000
```

# 7Ô∏è‚É£ Sending a request
Go to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser, you should see the following message:
```
{"message":"API is up and running!"}
```

Or send a post request to the `/predict` endpoint by running:
```bash
poetry run python -m api.api_requests -e predict
```
This should return a list of tuples with a prediction per ID for the `data/test.csv` file.

Or send a post request to the `/train` endpoint by running:
```bash
poetry run python -m api.api_requests -e train
```

This will train a Random Forest model on `data/train.csv` and save a model under `artifacts/rf.pkl`.
